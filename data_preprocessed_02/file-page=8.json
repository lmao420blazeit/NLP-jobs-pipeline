And last but not least  helping people like Heidrun:The senior citizen has been experiencing leg and foot pain while walking for several years. Her previous doctor diagnosed peripheral arterial occlusive disease in both legs. The patient underwent surgery to insert stents, but only achieved slight improvement.Unhappy with the results of the operation and her overall health situation, the 74-year-old sought the expertise recommended by BetterDoc. The specialist thoroughly examines the senior citizen and suggests that circulatory problems may be due to a narrowing of an abdominal artery. Consequently, he refers her to a hospital for further investigation. An angiography is conducted, confirming the specialist's suspicions: the patient indeed has a severe narrowing of an abdominal artery, causing the pain in her legs.This issue can be addressed through surgery, offering a causal treatment for the patient's pain.
