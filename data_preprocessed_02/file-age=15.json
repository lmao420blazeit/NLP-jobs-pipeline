I studied Psychology in my BSc and MSc thinking I will either stay in academia or go on a clinical psychology journey but then decided to move to business - a decision that I am very happy with since then!The last 8 years I have worked at tech startups at very different size and development stages (with employee count of 20 to 200). I have learned a lot and grown both as a professional and as a private person in those years thanks to the amazing people I have worked with.
