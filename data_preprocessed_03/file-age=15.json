I studied Psychology in my BSc and MSc thinking I will either stay in academia or go on a clinical psychology journey but then decided to move to business - a decision that I am very happy with since then!The last 8 years I have worked at tech startups at very different size and development stages (with employee count of 20 to 200). I have learned a lot and grown both as a professional and as a private person in those years thanks to the amazing people I have worked with. Here are some of those learnings I aspire to live by everyday:I strongly believe People topics cannot be worked on in isolation and have to address the needs of the business. Therefore all People Team Members have to be first and foremost members of the Entrix team and then our team.From entry level to the most senior members of the team, everyone is hired for a reason and that is to create a positive impact on the overall organization.My type of People people are those who are ambitious, eager to work on challenging tasks, are not scared of being challenged by others, have a strong focus on the outcome, and are motivated by the impact they create.Good leadership means that you are not only supported in your daily challenges but also in your career development setting you up for success whichever direction you aim to go.The rest, we will figure it out together  thank you for considering joining us, and I look forward to the possibility of working together!Best,Mge ArslantrkContactYour contact person is Kristina Kilian (People & Culture Manager).If you have any questions, feel free to send us an email to We are looking forward to receiving your
